4. Commit your changes to your branch

Solution must be efficient, try to avoid brute force solution and add comments if necessary, keep Big O notation in mind.

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the efficiency or complexity of an algorithm. It is used to analyze the performance of an algorithm in terms of how the runtime or space requirements grow as the size of the input to the algorithm increases.

### Basics of Big O Notation:
Definition: Big O notation, denoted as O(f(n)), describes the upper bound of the growth rate of an algorithm's runtime or space requirement relative to the size of the input, n.

Asymptotic Analysis: Big O notation focuses on the behavior of an algorithm as the input size approaches infinity. It helps in understanding how the algorithm scales with larger inputs without getting bogged down in the specifics of individual operations.

Function of Input Size: The "f(n)" in O(f(n)) represents a function of the input size, n, typically denoting the worst-case scenario. It is a mathematical function that characterizes the relationship between the input size and the algorithm's behavior.

Understanding Big O Classes:
O(1) - Constant Time: An algorithm with constant time complexity always takes the same amount of time or space to execute, regardless of the input size. Examples include basic arithmetic operations or accessing an element in an array by index.

O(log n) - Logarithmic Time: Algorithms with logarithmic time complexity reduce the size of the problem by a fraction with each step. Examples include binary search, where the search space is halved with each comparison.

O(n) - Linear Time: Algorithms with linear time complexity have a runtime or space requirement that grows linearly with the input size. Examples include traversing a list or array once.

O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time: Algorithms with linearithmic time complexity are typically found in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort.

O(n^2), O(n^3), ... - Polynomial Time: Algorithms with polynomial time complexity have a runtime or space requirement that grows with the square, cube, or higher powers of the input size. Examples include nested loops that iterate over a data structure.

O(2^n), O(n!) - Exponential and Factorial Time: Algorithms with exponential or factorial time complexity grow very rapidly with the input size and are considered highly inefficient for large inputs. Examples include recursive algorithms with branching factors or permutations.

Best, Average, and Worst Case Analysis:
Best Case: Represents the lower bound on the algorithm's performance. It describes the scenario where the algorithm performs optimally.
Average Case: Represents the expected performance of the algorithm over all possible inputs.
Worst Case: Represents the upper bound on the algorithm's performance. It describes the scenario where the algorithm performs the least efficiently.
Importance of Big O Notation:
Algorithm Comparison: Big O notation provides a standardized way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms independently of hardware or specific implementations.
Performance Prediction: It helps in predicting how an algorithm will behave as the size of the input grows, aiding in designing efficient algorithms for large-scale problems.
Optimization: By understanding the Big O complexity of an algorithm, developers can identify potential performance bottlenecks and optimize critical parts of the code.
In summary, Big O notation is a fundamental concept in computer science used to analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their runtime or space requirements as the input size increases. It provides a powerful tool for reasoning about algorithmic complexity and designing efficient algorithms.
